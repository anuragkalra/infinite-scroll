# Test Period

This test has not been run. It can be executed over a one-week period, a one-week period with fixed hour ranges, or a one-week period with stochastic hour ranges.

# A/B Test Variations

This A/B test included two experiments. The first experiment tested the effect of changing the style of the submit button on the user's submit button clicking behavior. The second experiment included a test on how changing the figure caption for each image effected the user's behavior, in terms of whether they clicked the giphy outbound link.

# Hypothesis

1. If submit button is colored in a brighter shade, then the submit button will be clicked more frequently (an increased number of search requests made), due to more significant screen impact and contrast.

2. If username is provided underneath a gif on hover, then the user is more likely to click the outbound link, due to increased user feedback and availability of information.
